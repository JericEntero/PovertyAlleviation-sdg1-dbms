NOTE TO REVIEWER:

The implementation of the project was done with pure SQL and with the entire implementation being done through the phpMyAdmin interface.

Since this option does not need the creation of a Web or CLI application, there are no files of executable programs in the demo interface folder.

All the setup instructions, instructions on how to execute the setup, and instructions on how to demonstrate everything (such as how to execute the stored procedure, how to trigger a test, and how to report the results) are contained in the main README.md at the root of the repository.
